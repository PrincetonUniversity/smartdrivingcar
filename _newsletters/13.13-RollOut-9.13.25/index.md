 Cities ran pilots, hosted workshops, and published white papers. But the tech wasn't ready. Cities grew disillusioned. Now the tech is here, and at scale. But most U.S. cities are not prepared. How should they? Please join Jinhua Zhao, Kara Kockleman and Robin

  [Tesla
 FSD (Supervised) V14.1 with Robotaxi-style dropoffs is here](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-fsd-supervised-v14-robotaxi-style-dropoffs-release-notes/#google_vignette)

S. Alvarez, Oct 7, "Tesla has started the rollout of Full Self-Driving (Supervised) V14.1, the advanced driver-assist system's most significant update in nearly a year.
 The release introduces vision-based navigation for real-time detour handling and a new "Arrival Options" feature that simulates Robotaxi-style drop-offs.

New Tesla Vision-based features

With Version 14.1, Tesla has integrated navigation and routing directly into its vision-based neural network, enabling the system to respond to scenarios
 such as blocked roads or closures in real time. The update also enhances emergency vehicle detection, allowing the car to pull over or yield when police, fire, or ambulances are nearby.

Other improvements include refined responses to debris, school buses, and lane cut-ins, as well as smoother handling of unprotected turns and gated entries.
 The update also adds a Robotaxi-style automatic camera-cleaning system. Tesla also promises improved fault recovery for greater reliability during degraded system operation.…. "

[Tesla FSD v14 comes with the laziest speed profile named 'Sloth'](http://teslaoracle.com/2025/10/07/tesla-fsd-v14-comes-with-the-laziest-speed-profile-named-sloth/)

I. Ali, Oct. 7 ,  "If the Chill mode is still fast for you while using Tesla's Full Self-Driving (Supervised), the automaker has something even cooler in
 the bag now.

Tesla (TSLA) began the rollout of FSD v14 earlier today. One of the most hyped FSD releases in history, with big promises from the CEO, Elon Musk. It's
 also the first major update in almost a year after V13.

FSD v14 now has a fourth speed profile named after the laziest animal in the world — 'Sloth'. The Sloth profile is in addition to the already slower FSD
 speed mode named 'Chill'.""    [Read

 This should be the default..  Speed Kills!  FSD should keep mis-behavers from mis-behaving. It should not embold mis-behavers to simply supervise a mis-behaving FSD.  In unsupervised FSD it needs to be the only mode.  If it is not, the unsupervised has zero
 chance (probability = 1.0x10-24) of being permitted on public roads.   Alain

[How San Francisco became Waymo-pilled](https://sfstandard.com/2025/10/08/san-francisco-became-waymo-pilled/)

R. Jetha, Oct. 8 ,  "It wasn't long ago that San Franciscans were at war with robotaxis. Fed up with the autonomous vehicles interfering with emergency
 responders and causing mile-long traffic jams, activists figured out a way to immobilize the machines by [placing traffic cones](https://sfstandard.com/2023/07/07/we-spoke-to-one-of-the-activists-coning-cruise-and-waymo-robotaxis-in-san-francisco/) on
 their hoods.

Public support for autonomous vehicles in San Francisco has surged, a new poll from the tech-backed, moderate-leaning political group GrowSF shows. Two-thirds
 of voters said they support allowing fully autonomous vehicles to operate in San Francisco. It's a significant increase from 2023, when fewer than half agreed with the sentiment…"    [Read
