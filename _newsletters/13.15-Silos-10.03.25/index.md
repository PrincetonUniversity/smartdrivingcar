MOBILITY INDUSTRY INSIGHTS
[In silos without windows: That's where driverless mobility research and development is done](https://www.michaellsena.com/mobility-industry-insights/)

M. Sena, Oct. 1,  "AT THE BEGINNING of the 20th century, people were not asking for
 cars. They were asking for a way to travel that did not require them to own and care for a horse. They were asking for a way to travel that allowed them to cover distances farther than they could walk in a day without having to provide their own motor power.
 They were asking for the possibility to travel where and when they desired, rather than according to a schedule devised by someone else. They were asking for a way to travel that they could master both physically and mentally. They were asking for a way to
 travel which they could afford. …

To repeat, no one is asking for driverless cars. …

There was no one in Los Angeles at the time of the riots, not the mayor or council members, not the social welfare organizers, not the state or federal members of congress,
 and definitely not Waymo and its parent Alphabet, who stood up and said, "Wait! The purpose of these self-driving cars is to give rides to people who cannot afford other transportation alternatives. Leave them alone!"…

There is a third vision…."

 Are Not Prepared for Autonomous Vehicles. ---Here's How Should They.](https://www.mmi.mit.edu/forum)

K. Kockelman, R. Chase & J. Zhao, Oct. 3, "Ten years ago, cities were energized by the promise of autonomous vehicles. In 2015, the buzz was loud. Cities ran pilots, hosted
 workshops, and published white papers. But the tech wasn't ready. Cities grew disillusioned.  Now the tech is here, and at scale. But most U.S. cities are not prepared. How should they?"

[Ashok Elluswamy is the most powerful Tesla executive you've never heard of](https://www.businessinsider.com/ashok-elluswamy-tesla-autopilot-elon-musk-ai-2025-10)

G. Kay & J. Newsham, Oct. 2 ,  "In 2022, [Elon Musk](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk) made a gamble that rattled his
 top engineers. The Tesla CEO scrapped the ultrasonic sensors that helped power the company's self-driving technology, and its vehicles began relying entirely on cameras.

No other self-driving car company had attempted anything like it. Complicating matters was the recent departure of Andrej Karpathy, Tesla's director of
 AI at the time. That left Ashok Elluswamy, then Tesla's head of Autopilot software, to carry out one of Musk's biggest bets.

Lewey Geselowitz, a former Autopilot engineer, said the team spent months training the software to run without the sensors. He recalled Elluswamy huddling
 inside a [Tesla](https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla) with a group of engineers, driving around the office parking lot. They were testing the system to see whether it would recognize objects in its path, intentionally almost slamming
 into walls in the process.

It was an example of Elluswamy going all-in to bring Musk's vision to fruition. A year later, the sensors had been removed from all new Tesla builds, leaving
 the driver-assist tech running solely off a suite of cameras. "It took courage to know that we would be able to figure that out," Geselowitz said….

"Without him and our awesome team," Musk [wrote on X](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1799650788848841069) last year, "we would
 just be another car company looking for an autonomy supplier that doesn't exist.""    [Read
