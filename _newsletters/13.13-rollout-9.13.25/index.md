[Elon Musk changes Tesla’s narrative: Jacques Nasser of Ford tried it twenty-five years ago](https://www.michaellsena.com/musings-on-mobility/)

 M. Sena , Sept. 1, “TESLA’S EARNINGS CALL on Thursday, the
 24th of July 2025, brought me back on a magic carpet ride to the summer of 2000. Twenty-five years is a rounding error at ten decimal places in Earth time, but for people born in 1947, like Jacques Nasser and your editor, two thirds of our lives reckoned by
 where we are today was behind us in 2000. Jacques Nasser would turn 53 at the end of that year, and he was at the pinnacle of his career, having been named President and CEO of Ford Motor Company in 1999. Where Nasser, Ford Motor Company, and the rest of the
 car companies were in the summer of 2000 is where I was taken on that carpet by what I heard from Elon Musk about Tesla in the summer of 2025. What happened to Nasser and Ford after that summer had a major impact on many lives, including my own. What will
 happen after this summer to Musk and Tesla will have lasting impacts as well….”    [Read more](https://www.michaellsena.com/musings-on-mobility/)

 Is the NY taxi industry going to be fined at least $500K the way Cruise was fined for something infinitely less egregious? We coddle mis-behaving humans while suffocating the life out of automated systems that mis-behave substantially less than their human
 counterparts? Mossetty was incarcerated @ Riker’s Island instead of receiving treatment at a psychiatric hospital is also a disgrace, The NY Times fails miserably at properly reporting on this tragedy.

Tesla Team, Sept. 1, “…  Humans are toolmakers. At Tesla, we make physical products at scale and at a low cost with the goal of making life better for everyone….

Autonomous vehicles have the capacity to dramatically improve the affordability, availability and safety of transportation while reducing pollution, particularly
 in our increasingly dense global cities….

Making technologically advanced products that are affordable and available at scale is required to build a flourishing and unconstrained society. It serves
 to further democratize society while raising everyone’s quality of life in the process. The hallmark of meritocracy is creating opportunities that enable each person to use their skills to accomplish whatever they imagine.  ….”    [Read

[Why
 People Blame Self-Driving Cars More Than Human Drivers](https://www.library.hbs.edu/working-knowledge/why-people-blame-self-driving-cars-more-than-human-drivers)

J. De Freitas, Sept. 9, “As carmakers look to expand the market for autonomous vehicles (AVs), they are hitting a psychological speed bump: People blame
 AVs more for accidents—even when they are not at fault.

Experiments with more than 5,000 respondents across three studies describe a common tendency: People imagine what would have happened if a perfect human
 driver had been behind the wheel instead of artificial intelligence (AI). This “what if” reaction could extend to AI in other sectors as well, says Harvard Business School Assistant Professor Julian De Freitas, representing a barrier to broader acceptance
 and expansion of the technology.

“It's different than when regular systems fail, because AVs are still this unfamiliar and unsettling technology,” says De Freitas, a co-author of the study
 and director of the Ethical Intelligence Lab at HBS. “And so, when there is an AI failure people fixate on the technology and imagine how things could have turned out differently had a superior driver been present instead.

This makes people more likely to view AV makers as liable, raising their legal and financial risk.”….”    [Read
