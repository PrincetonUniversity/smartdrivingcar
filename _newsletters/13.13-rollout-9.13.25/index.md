[Elon Musk changes Tesla’s narrative: Jacques Nasser of Ford tried it twenty-five years ago](https://www.michaellsena.com/musings-on-mobility/)

 M. Sena , Sept. 1, “TESLA’S EARNINGS CALL on Thursday, the
 24th of July 2025, brought me back on a magic carpet ride to the summer of 2000. Twenty-five years is a rounding error at ten decimal places in Earth time, but for people born in 1947, like Jacques Nasser and your editor, two thirds of our lives reckoned by
 where we are today was behind us in 2000. Jacques Nasser would turn 53 at the end of that year, and he was at the pinnacle of his career, having been named President and CEO of Ford Motor Company in 1999. Where Nasser, Ford Motor Company, and the rest of the
 car companies were in the summer of 2000 is where I was taken on that carpet by what I heard from Elon Musk about Tesla in the summer of 2025. What happened to Nasser and Ford after that summer had a major impact on many lives, including my own. What will
 happen after this summer to Musk and Tesla will have lasting impacts as well….”    [Read more](https://www.michaellsena.com/musings-on-mobility/)

Autonomous vehicles have the capacity to dramatically improve the affordability, availability and safety of transportation while reducing pollution, particularly
 in our increasingly dense global cities….

Making technologically advanced products that are affordable and available at scale is required to build a flourishing and unconstrained society. It serves
 to further democratize society while raising everyone’s quality of life in the process. The hallmark of meritocracy is creating opportunities that enable each person to use their skills to accomplish whatever they imagine.  ….”    [Read

[Why
 People Blame Self-Driving Cars More Than Human Drivers](https://www.library.hbs.edu/working-knowledge/why-people-blame-self-driving-cars-more-than-human-drivers)

J. De Freitas, Sept. 9, “As carmakers look to expand the market for autonomous vehicles (AVs), they are hitting a psychological speed bump: People blame
 AVs more for accidents—even when they are not at fault.

Experiments with more than 5,000 respondents across three studies describe a common tendency: People imagine what would have happened if a perfect human
 driver had been behind the wheel instead of artificial intelligence (AI). This “what if” reaction could extend to AI in other sectors as well, says Harvard Business School Assistant Professor Julian De Freitas, representing a barrier to broader acceptance
 and expansion of the technology.

“It's different than when regular systems fail, because AVs are still this unfamiliar and unsettling technology,” says De Freitas, a co-author of the study
 and director of the Ethical Intelligence Lab at HBS. “And so, when there is an AI failure people fixate on the technology and imagine how things could have turned out differently had a superior driver been present instead.

This makes people more likely to view AV makers as liable, raising their legal and financial risk.”….”    [Read

[Union Pacific
 and Norfolk Southern reach $85 billion merger deal](https://www.trains.com/trn/news-reviews/news-wire/union-pacific-and-norfolk-southern-reach-250-billion-merger-deal/)

B. Stephens, July 29, “Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern today announced an $85 billion deal to tie their networks together and create the first U.S. transcontinental
 railroad.

The merged company — which will be called Union Pacific — will transform the U.S. supply chain and economy, strengthen domestic manufacturing, and preserve
 all union jobs, the railroads said.

UP will acquire NS in a stock and cash transaction that values NS at $320 per share, a 25% premium. The combined company would have an enterprise value
 of more than $250 billion. The railroads said the merger would create $2.75 billion in annual synergies within three years, through a combination of $1.75 billion in revenue growth and $1 billion in cost savings.

“Railroads have been an integral part of building America since the Industrial Revolution, and this transaction is the next step in advancing the industry,”
 UP CEO Jim Vena said. “Imagine seamlessly hauling steel from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to Colton, Calif., and moving tomato paste from Heron, Calif., to Fremont, Ohio. Lumber from the Pacific Northwest, plastics from the Gulf Coast, copper from Arizona and
 Utah, and soda ash from Wyoming. Right now, tens of thousands of railroaders are moving almost everything we use. You name it, and at some point, the railroad hauled it.”

The railroad will stretch 52,215 route miles, with track winding through 43 states from the East Coast to the West Coast and serving around 100 ports...….”
  [Read
 more](https://www.trains.com/trn/news-reviews/news-wire/union-pacific-and-norfolk-southern-reach-250-billion-merger-deal/)  Hmmmm…
 Finally! I spent 25 years working towards such a goal.  Came within 2 weeks of a presentation to the ConRail board in 1996 with a serious proposal for it to purchase the Southern Pacific, only to be beaten to the punch by a UP move to purchase the SP, which
 thwarted  what could have been the first transcon [NAFTA](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R42965) RR.

Consequently, ConRail was carved up in ALK’s conference room with CSX on one side and NS on the other, and us running the numbers on the what ifs.
 All turned out very well for ConRail, NS and CSX shareholders, and the economy of the country. I have fond memories of those times and our team.

What will naturally follow now is a BN + CSX merger and the duopoly will be completed.

In the end, cooperation between shippers and carriers works best for both entities rather than using competition, which does little more than waste
 overhead to pit carriers against the other in a quest for survival of the fitter.

With these mergers on the table,  I’m having thoughts
[of putting the band back together](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/8QDQ_mCgCik?feature=share): George Woodward, Mark Hornung, Mike Bodden, Danni Titus, Benny Markowitz, …Déjà vu all over again.  It’s great! Alain

B. Templeton, July 9, “When it comes to self-driving and robotaxis, the most common argument is about Waymo vs. Tesla. Within the industry, most people
 think Waymo is the undisputed leader, and that Tesla isn’t even in the race. At the same time there are a number of people, not just Elon Musk, who think Tesla’s the leader or eventual winner. Now, we’re going to dive into this debate and discover why people

 See video… I, of course, respect Brad’s views.  He certainly has been deeply committed to all of this for a very long time. He does an excellent job.  Especially with
“… Unfortunately, removing that human is “the big one,” the hardest step in a robocar’s life–the moonshot,…”
I agree!!!   Where I mainly disagree is on the “why” in this battle.  I see neither as having the right “why”.

The fundamental “[Schumpeter-style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_destruction)” advantage of autonomousTaxis (“removing
 that human”) are their opportunity to provide high-quality mobility at a fraction of the cost of conventional means. All the other gizmos are nothing but window dressing.  Where that advantage is
[Schumpeter-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_destruction), that’s the market for autonomousTaxis!

The one that finds and serves that market will win!   Alain

[Is Elon Musk the Henry Ford
 of our day, and if he is, which Henry Ford, the myth, or the man?](https://www.michaellsena.com/musings-on-mobility/)

M. Sena, July 1, “My latest Musings is not about John Kenneth Galbraith, …. It is about attributing accomplishments of heroic proportions to men like Henry
 Ford and Elon Musk, sometimes erring on what it was they actually did and why it was important. I made the mistake of allowing my fondness for JKG's writing, and my general agreement with his views on politics and the business of government, color my description
 of his personality in the letter I sent that accompanied the Musings. I said Galbraith was "modest". I was apparently alone in this belief, as my good friend, faithful reader…, pointed out. Having scoured the online sources for comments on his notable personality
 traits, I found that the word 'arrogant' predominates. The clincher was a quote attributed to him by his Harvard University peers in a memorial following his death: “Modesty is a much overrated virtue.”

So, in spite of not being modest, he delivers a balanced view of Henry Ford in his chapter on the myth and the man, and it was that chapter that inspired
 my comparison of Ford and Musk. I shall attempt to be more careful with my words of praise in the future.

Hmmmm…
  Look for yourself [at the video](https://twitter.com/i/status/1938905507097461237).  Since automation was being used to perform a function as safely yet more efficiently than is done conventionally, it is justifiable that the demonstration was done without an on-board attendant, whose costs would have completely negated the
 automation’s efficiency contribution without improving safety.   Consequently, Tesla is fully justified in using this automation technology for this application without incurring the unjustifiable expense of an on-board attendant when that attendant doesn’t
 contribute any positive to safety or efficiency.

Also, I do realize that this publication is generally favorable to Tesla, so some may prefer to be skeptical about its reporting.  It is easy to find
 reportings presenting other perspectives.  Alain

R. Bishop, May 1, “Aurora Innovation, Inc. announced today that the company has launched its commercial self-driving trucking service
 in Texas.

This is a major milestone for on-road autonomy, at the same significance as Waymo’s 2018 debut of driverless services for people transport. Aurora’s journey started a year earlier, founded by veterans of the self-driving scene. The challenges of operating a
 tractor-trailer hauling up to 80,000 pounds of cargo at highway speeds have been daunting. More than a few companies tried and failed.

Following the closure of its safety case, Aurora is now running regular driverless customer deliveries between Dallas and Houston.  To date, the Aurora Driver has completed over 1,200 miles without a driver. The milestone makes Aurora the first company to operate
 a commercial self-driving service with heavy-duty trucks on public roads...   This hyperlapse

 details.  We had a great time.

[Paul
 Michel Lion III 12/7/1934 - 11/3/2024 RIP](https://obituaries.virginiacremate.com/obituaries/chantilly-va/paul-lion-12069013)

It is with my deepest sympathies and most humble condolences that I report the passing of my Doctor Father (Ph.D advisor) and life-long mentor, P. Michel
 Lion.  I owe everything to him!  He crafted my professional career. From the time in March 1967 when he interviewed me about possible late admission into Princeton's Aerospace and Mechanical Science's PhD program through just before he passed, he was a pillar
 of my academic life. As a newly minted Assistant Professor, he created and led Princeton's Aerospace System's Laboratory that in the ensuing five (5) years made substantial contributions to going to the moon and visions of Mars and the planets beyond.  When
 the mood of those aspirations diminished dramatically in the early seventies, he immediately envisioned the opportunity to pivot the Laboratory's
systems concepts from going to the heavens to using the to improve mobility, and thus the quality of life in our cities.  Thus, in 1972 created Princeton's
 Transportation Program that created the opportunity for me to return to Princeton, and became a critical element of the "Operations Research" part of Civil Engineering at Princeton that has evolved into what is today Princeton's 4th largest undergraduate major:
 the Department of Operations Research & Financial Engineering. Mike's pivot in 1972 was the "big bang" that created this marvelous legacy.

On a personal note, he is my son's namesake with slight modification of Michel to Michael in order to also honor his maternal grandfather and his God
 father.  He, Jane, and his sons have always been there for me and my family.  He is greatly missed. Alain

P.S. A celebration of life is being planned for 2pm Saturday, Nov. 17 in suburban Virginia.

M. Sena, September 26, “… It is when management becomes detatched from the business, the nitty gritty details, that things start to slide and principles are compromised. This
 is what appears to have happened at OnStar with customer data being shared with data aggregators and used for rating the driving performance for insurance purposes. Automotive companies used to pride themselves on having management and di[1]rectors who knew
 the business. Now they pride themselves on having people who know nothing about the business.

M. Sena, August 28, “Amidst wars, riots, assassination attempts, the Olympic Games, changes of presidential plans, and a two-day
 collapse of the world's stock markets, the automobile industry putters along, trying to find a balance between ICEs and BEVs. When the summer started, the U.S. and EU were slapping tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles, and the Chinese government was threatening
 to respond in turn. It has been quiet on both the western and eastern automotive fronts since then, but when summer turns to autumn, the topic of tariffs will rise again. The lead article in this September issue is intended to put a long range perspective
 on the issues and give one man's view of what is at stake for the players.".  Read more

[Time
 to Pivot](https://f.io/C1M3liTk)

Alain Kornhauser, August 25, “Following our very successful 6th Princeton SmartDrivingCar Summit at the end of May, Elizabeth and I have spent
 the summer preparing to pivot from commenting and Hmmm… ing
about what others are doing, or not doing, with SmartDrivingCars to preparing ourselves to actually do what Michael Sena and I described in our book:  “putting driverless
 vehicles to use for those who really need a ride”.

We are putting together a team to take the first step in actually beginning to capture some societal value out of the $300 Billion that’s been invested
 in this technology since the DARPA Challenges 20 years ago.  Just to have an RoI of 1.0 will require the giving of 30 Billion rides if the societal value of each ride averages @ $10/ride.  If only $1/ride, it will take 300 Billion rides for this technology
 to break even.

This certainly has been a moonshot investment in that it has been really hard, but so far, unless a lot is wiped clean, those that have been in it carry
 a heavy burden.

But what is sunk is sunk, so we are jumping in.  It looks like we’re going to call it HandyRides, Inc. and focus on taking the first step to implementing
 our book.   We have [version 1 of our elevator pitch](https://f.io/C1M3liTk)

[GM’s
 Cruise abandons Origin robotaxi, takes $583 million charge](https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/23/gms-cruise-abandons-origin-robotaxi-takes-583-million-charge/)

K. Korosec, July 23, “GM’s self-driving car subsidiary Cruise is scrapping plans to build the Origin — a purpose-built robotaxi
 with no steering wheel or pedals — and will instead use the next-generation Chevrolet Bolt in its operations.

GM Chair and CEO Mary Barra told shareholders Tuesday the decision will “simplify their path to scale” and addresses the regulatory
 uncertainty faced with the Origin robotaxi because of its unique design. The per-unit costs will also be much lower, which will help Cruise optimize its resources, Barra said in the shareholder letter released alongside the company’s second-quarter earnings.

GM reported a financial charge of $583 million in the second quarter that is tied to the non-cash write-off of Origin assets and
 other restructuring costs. The Cruise subsidiary had an operating loss of $1.14 billion in the second quarter that included a $605 million impairment charge …”

Welcome to the
Summer 2024

Alain Kornhauser, July 1, “…”.
Hmmmm… Welcome to the summer of 2024.

45 years ago to the day, my first wife Katherine and I launched our first “start-up” focused on fixing the hopelessly bankrupt Northeast railroads. Mark Hornung was the
 first employee and remained dedicated throughout his career as did others including Mike Bodden, Danni Titus, Dan Popkin and Michael Kornhauser, who for the past 11.5 years has grown and nurtured this critical pillar within its new parent.   I couldn’t be
 prouder!

Today, Elizabeth and I return to the Summer of ’79 and announce the launch of our start-up focused on creating the Proof-of-Market for "The Real Case for Driverless Mobility:
 Giving Rides to Those Who Really Need a Ride".  While we still don’t have a name for this entity and haven’t completed the legal arrangements, we do have a number of dedicated individuals willing to put in the sweat to identify in detail who really needs a
 ride from where to where, when and subsequently manage fleets of vehicles that serve their needs affordably.

Since at the beginning our capacity is miniscule, our efforts will be focused exclusively on serving those whose needs are greatest and can be served most safely.  As
 our capacity, technology and experience grows, we will scale to serve more of the many whose lives can be improved substantially from the availability of affordable high-quality mobility that serves their needs safely from where they are, to where they want
 to go, when they want to go there.

For now, we are finishing the paperwork and are calling our entity HandyRides, Inc.   Alain
